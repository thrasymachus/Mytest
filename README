This is my git repo, wherein I showcase work I've done with various web programming technologies (Yes, this is a shameless plug for myself, as I am putting this up to aid my job search :) ). I plan to organize these by the main technology used, e.g., Angular, Node, etc, and then later when I make some mockups of commercial sites, I'll organize them by project. 

Thanks for stopping by!
